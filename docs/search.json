    "text": "Preface\nThere’s a good chance that most people have heard of GDP—the famous or, dare I say, infamous Gross Domestic Product—, which is the yardstick used to measure the economic performance of countries and regions. However, fewer people have heard of the System of National Accounts, which is the underlying methodology to estimate it, along with a myriad of other macroeconomic measurements. Behind that simple number there is information on production, imports, exports, taxes, stock variation and many other aspects of economic life for hundreds of products. Putting all that information together is a monumental effort, often carried out by teams of dozens of persons in statistical offices or central banks around the world.\nThe System of National Accounts begins with the production account, which takes the form of two huge worksheets called supply and use tables—or SUTs in analyst lingo. They hold so much valuable information, but are less effective conveying most of that information effectively just due to their sheer size. From what I gather, and please don’t quote me on that, most schools of economics no longer have mandatory courses on National Accounts, which is a shame. I was lucky I still had to estimate Gross and Net National Savings for a final exam back in the early 2000s.",
